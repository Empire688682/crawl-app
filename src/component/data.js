      lyrics: `Baby is it a crime to love you?
  I don dey try, but I can’t undo
  You dey my mind every night and day
  Even when I pray, I call your name
  You sweet like sugarcane
  You dey burst my brain
  Tell me say na lie
  But girl, na you dey make me sane
  
  (Chorus)
  Baby is it a crime?
  To want you all the time?
  You dey drive me insane
  I just want you to be mine
  
  (Verse 2)
  From Lagos to UK
  I go carry your matter for display
  No delay, I dey come straight
  For your love, girl, I go run relay
  You be my melody
  Girl, you be my symphony
  No other girl can take your place
  You dey give me sweetest grace`,
